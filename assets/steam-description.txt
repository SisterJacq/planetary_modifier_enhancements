[h1]Overview[/h1]

I wanted to tweak a few modifiers related to planetary bonuses to more flavorful bonuses.

[olist]
[*]The C.A.R.E Interactive Interface is an economic optimization engine, so I wanted it to give a bonus to trade value
[*]The Extensive Moon System modifier adds mining districts and output... to gas giants which can't be colonized, so I changed it to give a bonus to mining stations (but not research stations) that also applies to any unhabitable moons, and moved the bonus mineral jobs production and mining districts onto any/all habitable moons
[*]The Resource Consolidation origin goes through all the trouble of shrinking gas giants and converting them to molten worlds tagged with the "Chthonian Planet" modifier but then a game start event clears all modifiers, so I wanted to stop blanket deleting planetary modifiers in starting systems
[/olist]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

This mod should be widely compatible with other mods.  Incompatibilities would likely occur if other mods also overwrite or add same the planetary or static modifier IDs.  If another mod is attempting to specify the same modifiers: first in wins for static modifiers, but last in wins for planetary modifiers.  For now, only these [i]static_modifiers[/i] are overridden (and no [i]planet_modifiers[/i]):

[list]
[*][i]extensive_moon_system[/i]
[*][i]pm_planetary_mechanocalibrator[/i] (there is also a [i]planet_modifier[/i] with the same key but it is unchanged)
[/list]

This mod also overrides a game setup event [i]game_setup.2[/i].  I find it unlikely other mods would be changing this event (it clears planetary modifiers for home systems); in any case first in wins for events.

This mod is not compatible with achievements because it overwrites data from core Stellaris files.

[h3]Post-Game Start[/h3]

This mod can be safely added to your save after the game has started, but not removed.  If this mod is not active at game start, you will miss out of the Extensive Moon System (Moon) modifier being applied to the moods of gas giants with Extensive Moon System.  Removing this mod will result in unknown planetary modifiers - which Stellaris may or may not handle gracefully.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]

Overriding an event causes the game to log an error, so expect to see one line in the error.log file similar to:

[code]
[20:11:11][eventmanager.cpp:355]: an event with id [game_start.2] already exists!  file: events/game_start.txt line: 213
[/code]
